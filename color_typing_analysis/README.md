## Pokemon Color & Typing - Co-Occurrence & Probability Analysis
This folder contains workbooks to do the probability analysis for colors, typing, and a combo of both..

## Getting Started
Prerequisite: Python 3

### Running the project
1. Install the required libraries: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the `co_occurrences_aggregate.ipynb` file
3. Change the customizable variables in the second code section to something else, or leave as is.
4. Run all the code sections from top onwards, and check out the files created in "co_occurences" and "probabilities" folders
5. After completed, open `co_occurrence_prob_charts.ipynb` and do a first run-through of all code sections to set all the functions and variables and create initial charts.
6. Once done, you can go in and customize the variables above each chart to have different outcomes displayed
    - `range_between`: the lower and upper limit to mask the data within
    - `steps`: number of steps to take within the range (also determines number of charts output)
    - `increment`: amount to increment the lower limit of `range_between` per `step`

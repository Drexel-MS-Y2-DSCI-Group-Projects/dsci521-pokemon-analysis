# Instructions for creating the Chord diagrams

Running the `chord_diagram.ipynb` file should be pretty straight forward and painless. It should work out-of-the-box and not require any initial setup.

To toggle between generating the Chord diagram for colors and types, update the `key` variable to either `colors` or `types`.

Simply hit run and you should see a Chord diagram generated.
